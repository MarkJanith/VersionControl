The day I met my soul mate

It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
I could not hear anything other than my own footsteps.
I was calm and quite until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own foot steps.

Anyway I followed my own steps, after few seconds ago i thought they are not mine.
I saw someone looking at me like a angel, I felt she will be soul mate.
