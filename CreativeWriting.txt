The day I met my soulmate.

It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
I could not hear anything other than my own footsteps.
I was calm and quiet until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own foot steps.

I started to walk again and again.Suddenly, I felt someone's foot steps are getting close to me.I stopped walking and looked behind.
I was shocked by seeing him. He is none other than, my soulmate Bob. I was really happy by seeing him and his attractive smile gaves me goosebumps.
